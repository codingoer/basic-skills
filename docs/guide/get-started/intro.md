# Introduction

## Vuepress

VuePress is a markdown-centered static site generator. You can write your content (documentations, blogs, etc.) in **Markdown**, then VuePress will help you to generate a static site to host them.

Each Markdown file is compiled into HTML with [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) and then processed as the template of a Vue component

Though VuePress has extended Markdown syntax to a certain extent, it still lacks some commonly used functions, such as text alignment, mark, flowchart, formula, presentation, etc. At the same time, some features provided by the default theme are weak or missing, such as picture preview, dark mode, etc.

In this case, the design of `vuepress-theme-hope` was born.

This theme not only greatly improve outlook comparing to `@vuepress/theme-default`, but also dedicates to provide a full range of enhancements for VuePress with its plugins.

::: warning This project is not only a theme

Although [vuepress-theme-hope/vuepress-theme-hope](https://github.com/vuepress-theme-hope/vuepress-theme-hope) itself marked as a theme repository, it also contains more than a dozen equally complete and powerful plugin. Each plugin is also powerful, can be used with the default theme or third-party themes.

Based on such a dozen plugins, Mr.Hope can confidently say that `vuepress-theme-hope` is "**A powerful theme with tons of features**". It can also be seen as the most versatile and comprehensive theme among all VuePress themes.
